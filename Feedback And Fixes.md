# AgriConnect Usability Feedback

## Feedback from Users
- **Loading:** Users noticed that the loading spinner sometimes disappears too quickly on slower connections.
- **Mobile Interactions:** Buttons and cards lack clear tap feedback; hover effects on desktop are fine.
- **Search:** Typing quickly causes a slight lag and flickering in the results.

## 3 Main Fixes Implemented
1. **Improve Loading Animation**
   - Spinner now stays visible until all content is fully loaded.
   - Added fade-in animation for the main content after loading.

2. **Enhance Mobile Micro-Interactions**
   - Added tap animations (`active:scale-95`) on buttons.
   - Commodity cards now have smooth hover/tap effects for better feedback.

3. **Optimize Search Experience**
   - Added debounce to the search input to prevent flickering.
   - Inline spinner shows while search results are updating.
